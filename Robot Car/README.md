Name of the project: Self Collision Detection Robot Car

Description: 
This project encompasses most of the L293D driver shield functionalities, by using both DC motors and a servo motor. 
The car robot is programmed to move forward and to detect the front collision in a range of 10 cm. The obtacle check is done
using an ultrasonic sensor. Once the obstacle is detected, the robot stops, moves backwards and rotates the sensor, using the servo, 
to determine the safest path to continue to: left or right.
