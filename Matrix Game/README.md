Project name: brick breaker

Description: this game has some similarities with the well known brick breaker game, but the details and complexity of the initial game change throughout levels. The goal of the game is not to break all bricks, only one brick structure, bigger or smaller, depending on the level. However, as you advance in level, the difficulty changes, as you will also have obstacles to avoid, the player slide gets smaller, the brick structure is harder to reach. Also, you will have less and less time to complete the levels.

How the game meets the requirements: 
- hardware used: 8x8 led matrix, joystick, driver, lcd.
- game specifications: it has a score, the player is time pressured, there are multiple creative levels so the player doesn't get bored, the levels change in complexity and difficulty, the player will be rewarded if it has a win streak(one win = one completed level), animations will be added after each completed level, the highscore highly depends on the win streaks, since the game punishes you for each loss.
